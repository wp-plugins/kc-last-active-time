== Description ==

<p>When use WordPress as CMS sometimes it needs to show when users was online last time. No such feature in the core of WordPress, so this plugin adds it.</p>
<p>Feel free to review all my <a href="http://krumch.com/category/wp_plugins/" target="_blank">other plugins</a>.</p>

== Installation ==

Nothing special, just a generic installation. You can set it in admin area (adds new row in “Settings”), but default settings works just fine.

== Usage ==

You can place [kc_last_active_time] (or [kc_lat]) shortcode anywhere, in themes, headers, footers, posts and pages.

Also you can use kc_lat_get() function in PHP code in plugins, themes etc.

In the admin area page you will find usage info too. Also there you will find fields for date format and for wrapping CSS class.
